# HideSettingsPages
GUI for setting a Registry key to hide individual pages in the Windows 10 Settings app on the Creators Update and newer.


Thanks to Microsoft for implementing this feature into Windows 10, Windows Central for posting an article on [how to use this feature](http://www.windowscentral.com/how-hide-settings-pages-windows-10-creators-update), and a commenter going by the name of ["DragonPoo" for the indirect suggestion](http://www.windowscentral.com/how-hide-settings-pages-windows-10-creators-update#comment-2761513).

Currently, HideSettingsPages is just a GUI and the only actual code is used to update the titlebar.
